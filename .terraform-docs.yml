  ## Usage

  The roles, users, and accounts will be merged with the cluster roles and added to a new `aws-auth` configmap managed with Terraform state.

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/complete/complete.tf.docs" }}
  ```

  Please see the [complete example](examples/complete) for more information.

  ## Patch ConfigMap

  The aws-auth configmap will be patched in-place with `kubectl` and will not be managed with Terraform state.

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/patch/patch.tf.docs" }}
  ```

  Please see the [patch example](examples/patch) for more information.
